    - role: Graduate Assistant - Assistant Lecturer - Lecturer
      time: 2010 - Present
      company: Department of Computer Science, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia
      details: |
        <b>Courses Thought</b>: Introduction to Computer Science, Introduction to Programming, Advanced Programming in Unix Environment, Data Structures and Analysis of Algorithms, Theory of Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, Database Management Systems, High-Performance Computing.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Other tasks</b>: I established an undergraduate research & development lab at the Department of Computer science, 4K Labs, with brought students and faculty from multiple academic units together (i.e., Department of Computer Science, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and School of Mechanical Engineering) to work on cross-discipline research endeavors such as Robotics, Autonomies Vehicles and IoT. As one of the achievements of this Lab, we took part in the African RoboCup Soccer competition and won first prize. We have also won a small grant from the Internet Society to work on Smart Home Project.
        <br />
        <br />
        Through this lab and other collaborations, I got the chance to work on projects with amazing students and colleagues. One such project is to build Amharic Morphological Generator as part of an effort to build a morphological analyzer for the Amharic language. The core idea behind the generator is to build a morphological tree from root words and prune the tree using a corpus of valid words with the aim of identifying valid inflectional rules in one of the most morphologically complex languages, Amharic. We managed to demonstrate proof of concept with a few sample roots and subsequent endeavors will focus on scaling the solution to all root words in the language.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another project I've worked on with students is a decision support system for student advising using a rule-based declarative language. The primary goal of the project was to build a software architecture and a prototype that decoupled the business logic of the student information system at the university in order to make the rule editable without the need to rebuild the entire system again. Traditionally such a system is built using imperative programming languages such as Java, C#, or PHP where the rules of the system are hardcoded into a logical code block. This limited the flexibility of the system as business rules change. By decoupling this logic from the other components of the software it can be loaded from a logic engine built with technologies such as prolog at runtime. We developed a prototype e-advisor and demonstrated the feasibility of such architecture. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Other projects I've worked on include a computer vision-based campus car parking management system, an organizational document metadata store, and a tracking system.
